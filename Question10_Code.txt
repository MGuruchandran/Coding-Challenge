Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings s1 and s2 return the length of the longest common subsequence of characters between the two strings.

Example 1:

Input:
s1 = "ABCD"
s2 = "ABCD"

Output: 4
Explanation:
"ABCD"
"ABCD"
Both strings share the subsequence "A", "B", "C", "D".


Example 2:

Input:
s1 = "ADC"
s2 = "ABCD"

Output: 2
Explanation:
"ADC"
"ABCD"
Both strings share the subsequence "A", "D".


Example 3:

Input:
s1 = "DBC"
s2 = "CBD"

Output: 1
Explanation:
"DBC"
"CBD"
      or
"DBC"
"CBD"
      or
"DBC"
"CBD"





 Class A{
    predefined attributes 
    Metjod
    Propertyies
} --> In DLL

We have to expose this A as an attribute

can we have any class have tht as a attribute?

reflection get the attribute


Class A {
    SomeClass Value;
    
}
